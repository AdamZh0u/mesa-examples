## Wolf-Sheep Predation Model

Another ABM standard. Wolf and sheep wander around the grid randomly and reproduce. When a wolf and a sheep end up on the same grid cell, the wolf eats the sheep. 

 Implemented here to test / demonstrate several Mesa concepts and features:
 - MultiGrid
 - Multiple agent types (wolves, sheep, possibly grass)
 - Writing a model composed of multiple files.
 - Writing a generalizable behavior (in this case, random movement) 
 - Dynamically adding and removing agents from the schedule
 - (Eventually) visualizing a layered grid, with a grass layer, a wolf layer and a sheep layer.
